How to compile/run the program:
(a) run the program:
In the terminal we enter the proper folder cd Desktop/Projects/Project2, Project2 contains the source files main.c resource.c event.c manager.c, system.c and defs.h, then we make the code an compile our source files into object files by using the command prompt “make”(side note: and also “make clean” after running the program)
(b)Then by running the program with ./Project2
(c)We can also test it with valgrind ./Project2 to check for any memory leaks, where we could see that we had no memory leaks and all the memory that was allocated was properly freed
